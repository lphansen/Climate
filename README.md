# Pricing Uncertainty Induced by Climate Change



This repository contains codes and jupyter notebooks which estimates and demonstrates results of the empirical model in "Pricing Uncertainty Induced by Climate Change" by [Michael Barnett][id3], [William Brock][id2] and [Lars Peter Hansen][id1]. Latest version could be found [here][id4].

## Acessing our jupyter notebook
To access our notebook, please follow steps below:
1.	Open a Windows command prompt or Mac command terminal and change into the folder you would like to store the files. 
    - You can do this using the command __cd__ in the command prompt.    
    - For example, running "cd “C:\Users\username\python” " (don’t forget “” around the path name to use an absolute path) would lead me to my designated folder.
```
cd [folder path name]
```
2.	Clone the github repository for the paper 
    - If you don’t have github installed, try installing it from this page: https://git-scm.com/download/win.
    - You can do this by running in the command prompt. 
```
git clone https://github.com/lphansen/Climate
```
3.	To download the data you'll need, go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TVVqditjA489NNSD8H32u0e4eIJkoj0r?usp=sharing and copy the .pickle files into the subfolder __data__ under the git repo __Climate__ you just cloned.
4.	Run __install.bat__ for those who used windows or run __install.sh__ for those who used Mac OS by double clicking the file.
5.	Go back to command line prompt, change directories into the ‘Climate’ folder and open jupyter notebook by running below in command prompt
    - If you don’t have anaconda3 and jupyter notebook installed, try installing from this page: https://jupyter.org/install.html
```
cd Climate
jupyter notebook
```
6.	We provide three notebooks:
    - "PaperResultsIllustration.ipynb" demonstrates interactive figures shown in the paper. 
    - “ConsumptionModel.ipynb” demonstrates the computational details and codes on how we solve the model under consumption damage settings
    - “GrowthModel.ipynb” demonstrates growth damage settings. Click on the files to access them.
7. Run notebooks cell by cell or click "Run all" from "kernel" in the menu bar to see details about our model results and computational details.
